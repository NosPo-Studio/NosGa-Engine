--[[NosGa:
	Bugs:
		EH:
			Worse performance/freeze on signal overflow.
		
		*? Memory leak on game restart/stop.
		
		gameObjects:
			*Speed shouldn't be more as the texturePack size (ocgf.RigidBody).
	
	ToDo:
		dataLoading: 
			Rewrite:
				Sub dir parsing:
					Sub table option (for data/globalStructured/ e.g.).
					No sub table option (for data/global/ e.g.).
					
				All conf files in one table.
				INI control file (see internal expected table in controls.lua).
		
		Rename pDraw etc. to ngeDraw... .
			
		ocgl:
			Add calculateSize(texture) function.
		
		Add dynamic texture color system (ocgl/ocgf).
			
			
	*left over from ocCraft but still relevant somehow.
