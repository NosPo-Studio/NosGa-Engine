--[[NosGa:
	Bugs:
		Animations:
			Not working. Created animations are the GameObject.
			
		EH:
			Worse performance/freeze on signal overflow.
		
		*? Memory leak on game restart/stop.
		
		gameObjects:
			*Speed shouldn't be more as the texturePack size (ocgf.RigidBody).
		
		Console:
			Text input is buggy sometimes (ocui?).
		
		RE:
			Graphic isures on RenderArea leaving GameObjects.
	
	ToDo:	
		GameObject:
			Add automatic "global.extentFunction" functuinality to parents (pUpdate...).
		
		oclrl:
			Add calculateSize(texture) function.
		
		Add dynamic texture color system (oclrl/ocgf).
			
		GameObject/RE:
			Replayce CopyArea with ClearArea .
			
	*left over from ocCraft but still relevant somehow.
