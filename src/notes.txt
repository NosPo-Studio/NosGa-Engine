new render engine:
	only drawing textures if necessary.
	copy overlapping textures only to the last pos using draw area to prevent chain overlap checking.
	check overlapping only on movement or if transparent sprites have "mustBeRendered" set to true.
	set "mustBeRendered" to true every time the texture has to be drawed by animation change or movement.
		
	camMoving:
		still copy frame/buffer on cam move.
		just add to toRender with necesarry area if only need to be drawed by cam movement.
		ignore area if "mustBeRendered" is true.
	
	DB: 
		drawing from DB backbuffer into the VRAM back buffer to realize transparent textures:
			buffered textures has to be written into the DB front buffer on drawing.
			
		optional direct texture drawing to the VRAM back buffer to avoid using DB buffers at all:
			(DB modification necessary.)
		
	multiple areas per gameobjet possible. for the case it overlaps with multiple other gameobjects.
		maybe only usefull for non buffered textures?
	
	keep hasMoved/mustRendered mechanic:
		only need to rerender sprites below if it hasMoved or is transparent.
